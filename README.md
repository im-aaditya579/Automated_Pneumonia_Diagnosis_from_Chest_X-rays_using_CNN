# Pneumonia_Detection_Using_Chest_X-ray_images
The proposed system uses Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture tailored for this specific medical imaging task, it comprises of multiple convolutional layers for feature extraction and fully connected layers for the final binary classification decision. A pre-trained model of   16 is also used on 5,863 X-Ray images (JPEG) which are in 2 categories Pneumonia/Normal.
